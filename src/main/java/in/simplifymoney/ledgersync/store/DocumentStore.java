/**
 * The document store the ledger is moving to. NOT IMPLEMENTED - this is yours.
 *
 * These three methods are the only access patterns this service has. Design
 * your documents so the engine can serve them directly. We are not going to
 * tell you what the documents should look like; that decision is the point of
 * the exercise.
 *
 * For each method your submission must report, at 100,000 transactions, how
 * many items the engine EXAMINED versus how many it RETURNED. Both DynamoDB
 * (ScannedCount vs Count) and MongoDB (totalDocsExamined vs nReturned) give you
 * this directly. Put the numbers in your README.
